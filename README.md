#  Semester 2 - Programming for Data Analysis Project


## Brendan Ryan, GMIT Student - January 2020

### How to run or view the Jupyter Notebook

- The Jupyter notebook can be viewed on my My repository is held on GitHub - https://github.com/brendantipp/sem2_prog_data_analysis_project


- You can also download and run the Jupyter notebook from the repository to your local hard drive and open with Jupyter Notebooks - www.jupyter.org

The following is useful step by step guide on how to open and run a jupyter notebook - https://jupyter-notebook-beginner-guide.readthedocs.io/en/latest/execute.html

### Details of Git Repository

The repository for the assignment and all the files are located here https://github.com/brendantipp/sem2_prog_data_analysis_project

#### The Task relating to the contents in the repository

Project task to create a sythesised Dataset simulating a real world phenomenon.

I have picked on a real world phenomenon in my own professional life. This is what is the likelyhood of a member of the finanical instituion I work in availing of a service (in this case take a loan), based on their age, sex and employment status and then look at the the type of product they normally borrow for.

### The Software used

- Annacoda distribution package (Python, Git) - www.anaconda.com
- Jupyter Notebook - www.jupyter.org
- cmder - www.cmder.net
- Github www.github.com


#### Libraires/Packages used and imported
I will be using the numpy.random package from python and I will also be utilising the Matplotib and Seaborn packages for better visualisation using graphs. These packages/libraries are imported into my Jupyter notebook and the code to do this is documented in my jupyter notebook.
